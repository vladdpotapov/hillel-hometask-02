                    Keanu Charles Reeves 
                    is a Canadian actor and musician. 
                    He gained fame for his starring roles in several blockbuster 
                    films, including comedies from the Bill and Ted franchise 
                    (1989–2020); action thrillers Point Break (1991), Speed (1994), 
                    the John Wick franchise (2014–present); psychological thriller 
                    The Devil's Advocate (1997); supernatural thriller Constantine
                    (2005); and science fiction/action series The Matrix (1999–2003).
                    He has also appeared in dramatic films such as Dangerous Liaisons 
                    (1988), My Own Private Idaho (1991), and Little Buddha (1993),

                    Reeves has earned critical acclaim for his acting. One New 
                    York Times critic praised Reeves' versatility, saying that he 
                    "displays considerable discipline and range... he moves easily
                    between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural
                    story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles."However,
                    Reeves has spent much of his later career being typecast. 
                    Saving the world is a recurring character arc in many roles 
                    he has portrayed, as manifested in characters such as Ted 
                    "Theodore" Logan, Siddhartha Buddha, Neo, Johnny Mnemonic,
                    John Constantine, and Klaatu. The John Wick franchise 
                    represented a return to critical praise and commercial 
                    success for Reeves.[6][7][8] His acting has garnered 
                    several awards, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk 
                    of Fame.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of film acting, Reeves has pursued other forms of 
                    artistry, including stage acting, music performing, and directing.
                    Onstage, he performed as Prince Hamlet for the Manitoba Theatre 
                    Centre's production of Hamlet. He is a musician and played bass
                    guitar for the bands Dogstar and Becky. He wrote the text for 
                    a picture book, Ode to Happiness, illustrated by Alexandra 
                    Grant. He has also produced a documentary, Side by Side, and
                    directed the martial arts film Man of Tai Chi.

                        James McAvoy (/ˈmækəvɔɪ/; born 21 April 1979) is a
